            Currently, the main dominant strain in the world is the Delta variant strain. As of September 22, 2021, the delta variant strain has been discovered in 185 countries and regions. First identified in India, the Delta variant is characterized by significantly increased transmissibility, shortened incubation and intergenerational periods, and possibly increased disease severity. Currently, in China, since two tourists tested positive for nucleic acid in Xi 'an city of Shaanxi Province, a number of associated cases have been reported in Gansu, Inner Mongolia, Hunan, Guizhou, Ningxia, Hebei and Beijing, all of which were infected with the Delta mutant strain.

              Vaccine is a powerful tool in fighting against the pandemic. Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, WHO (the World Health Organization) chief scientist, said that the delta variant is highly infectious and there has been cases of people still infected with the virus after vaccination, but the vaccine can still effectively prevent severe illness and death caused by the delta variant. On October 7, 2021, WHO announced the launch of global COVID-19 vaccination strategy, aiming to vaccinate 40 percent of the world's population by the end of 2021 and 70 percent by mid-2022. The new strategy is expected to cost 8 billion dollars and require 11 billion doses of vaccine. In China, as of October 21, 2021, the cumulative number of injected vaccine doses had exceeded 2.24 billion. However, from the global perspective, the problem of uneven vaccine distribution and imbalanced vaccination remains severious. By mid-October, 2021, China had provided more than 1.5 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines to more than 100 countries and international organizations, and will try the best to provide 2 billion doses throughout the year.

            The rapid spread of the pandemic has posed a huge impact on the world economy and politics. The interruption of trade between countries has slowed down the growth of the world economy, and economic globalization is facing a huge challenge. The outbreak of the epidemic is inevitably to act as a catalyst for major changes in the world, especially as China and the United States are becoming the most important forces in the international political landscape.
